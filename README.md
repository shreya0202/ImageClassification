# ImageClassification

The network architecture for VGG16 model is chosen for the assignment, which takes as input an image of dimensions
(224x224x3). For simplicity in the program, the current image dataset is resized to provide images of dimensions (128x128x3).
The dataset was divided, 30 images per class were taken as training and the rest were used for testing. Two models were
created, one with random weights (Model0) and other with trained Imagenet weights (Model1).
